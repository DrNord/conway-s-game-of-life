### ***Watch primitive cells evolve in their primitive universe***

Открыть версию на русском языке: [RU].

The famous **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton invented in 1970 by *John Horton Conway* - the British mathematician. It is a zero-player game - the initial state fully determines the game evolution.

 Despite no further input is required, the game is equipped with advanced interface including editing, saving/loading and navigating with touchscreen support (see in-game instructions for details).
